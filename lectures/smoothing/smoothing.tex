\section{Trouble in high dimensions?} 

\def\new{\text{new}}

\begin{itemize}
\item As in the regression lecture, let's suppose that we seek $\beta \in \R^p$  
  such that for given samples $x_i \in \R^p$ and $y_i \in \R$ (predictor and
  response pairs), $i = 1,\dots,n$,    
  \[
  y_i \approx x_i^\T \beta, \quad  i = 1,\dots,n 
  \]
  (As explained in that lecture, our notation omits the intercept from the
  model, but that is done without a loss of generality, since it can always be
  obtained by appending a coordinate value of 1 to the start of each $x_i$) 

\item Equivalently, we can write $y \in \R^n$ for the response vector (with
  $i\th$ component $y_i$) and $X \in \R^{n \times p}$ for the feature matrix
  (with $i\th$ row $x_i)$, and say that we are seeking $\beta$ such that $y
  \approx X \beta$ 

\item Recall, the least squares estimates of the coefficients are given by
  solving  
  \begin{equation}
  \label{eq:ls}
  \min_{\beta \in \R^p} \, \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - x_i^\T \beta)^2 \iff
  \min_{\beta \in \R^p} \, \|y - X \beta\|_2^2
  \end{equation}
  where we use $\|\cdot\|_2$ for the Euclidean or $\ell_2$ norm of a vector,
  defined for $a \in \R^d$ as \smash{$\|a\|_2^2 = \sum_{i=1}^d a_i^2$}

\item If $p \leq n$ and $\rank(X) = p$ (here $\rank(X)$ denotes the rank of the 
  matrix $X$), then this produces the unique solution    
  \begin{equation}
  \label{eq:coef}
  \hbeta = (X^\T X)^{-1} X^\T y  
  \end{equation}

\item But if $p > n$, which means we have more features than samples, which we 
  often call the ``high dimensional'' (or ``overparametrized'') setting, then we 
  are in trouble ... the matrix $X^\T X$ cannot be invertible, so the expression
  in \eqref{eq:coef} isn't even well-defined   

\item Moreover, the least squares optimization problem \eqref{eq:ls} does not
  have a unique solution in this case. Indeed, are you'll show on the homework,
  it \smash{$\tilde\beta$} is one solution, then any other vector of the form    
  \begin{equation}
  \label{eq:coef_eta}
  \hbeta = \tilde\beta + \eta, \quad \text{where $\eta \in \nul(X)$}
  \end{equation}
  also solves \eqref{eq:ls}, where $\nul(X)$ is the null space of the matrix
  $X$:
  \[
  \nul(X) = \{ \eta \in \R^p : X \eta = 0 \} 
  \]

\item When $\rank(X) < p$, the null space $\nul(X)$ is nontrivial, and since it  
  is a linear space: $\eta \in \nul(X) \implies c \eta \in \nul(X)$ for any $c
  \in \R$, we see that from one least squares solution \smash{$\tilde\beta$}, we
  can generate \emph{infinitely many others} in \eqref{eq:coef_eta} 
  
\item Furthermore, we can always take the ``one least squares solution'' to be:  
  \begin{equation}
  \label{eq:coef_mn}
  \tilde\beta = (X^\T X)^+ X^\T y
  \end{equation}

  \item Here $A^+$ denotes the \emph{generalized inverse} (also called the 
  \emph{Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse}) of a matrix $A$. If you don't know what
  that is, then it doesn't really matter for this lecture, but you can think of
  it precisely as follows: among all solutions in \eqref{eq:ls}, the solution in
  \eqref{eq:coef_mn} is the unique one having the smallest $\ell_2$ norm 
  \smash{$\|\tilde\beta\|_2$} 

\item So, now we come to the discussion of specific \emph{troubles}. There are
  actually two distinct troubles. The first trouble involves the interpretation
  of the coefficients themselves. If we are interested in such interpretations,
  then the $p = n$ barrier is the end of the road for least squares. Why? Once
  $p > n$, and we find any least squares solution \smash{$\tilde\beta$} with
  \smash{$\tilde\beta_j > 0$} for some $j$, then we can always
  find\footnote{Technically, this is only true if $\nul(X) \not \perp e_j$,
    where $e_j$ is the $j\th$ standard basis vector.}  
  another solution \smash{$\hbeta$} of the form \eqref{eq:coef_eta} with
  \smash{$\hbeta_j < 0$}. You will prove this on the homework. Thus we cannot
  even consistently interpret the sign of any of any estimated coefficient (let
  alone its magnitude) 

\item The second trouble involves prediction. The $p = n$ barrier is generally
  disastrous for least squares prediction. If $p < n$ and \smash{$\hat{y}_{\new}
    = x_{\new}^\T \hbeta$} is the least squares prediction at a new predictor
  value \smash{$x_{\new}$} (for \smash{$\hbeta$} the usual least squares
  coefficients in \eqref{eq:coef}), whose associated response is
  \smash{$y_{\new}$}, then under fairly standard conditions for regression
  theory,
% \footnote{This assumes that the true model is linear and the errors are
%   independent of the features (as well as assuming that the data are all
%   i.i.d., and some other mild-ish conditions on the distributions of the
%   errors and features that are not worth mentioning). In other words, it is a
%   fairly idealized model. So the fact that least squares performs poorly here
%   as $p$ approaches $n$, in this model, is especially notable.} 
  the prediction MSE behaves as: 
  \[
  \E \big[ (y_{\new} - \hat{y}_{\new})^2 \big] \approx \sigma^2
  \frac{p}{n-p} 
  \]
  for large $n$ and $p$, where $\sigma^2$ is the error variance. What do we
  notice? This explodes as $p$ approaches $n$. Big problem!

\item This is being driven by the \emph{variance} of the predictions from least 
  squares, which grows out of control as $p$ approaches $n$

\item (An interesting side note: what happens with the prediction MSE when $p >
  n$? The answer may surprise you. The MSE associated with \eqref{eq:coef_mn} is
  actually quite interesting and in some ways exotic when $p > n$. Typically we 
  need $p$ to be \emph{much larger} than $n$ (away from the $p = n$ barrier) in
  order for it to be well-behaved. This has been the topic of a recent flurry of
  research in statistics in machine learning ...  we won't cover this, but feel
  free to ask about it in office hours)     
\end{itemize}

\section{Regularization}

\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Regularization} to the rescue! This will finesse both of the
  problems described above: it leads to nontrivial coefficient estimates, and
  often leads to more accurate predictions, by reducing variance  

\item In the regression setting, a general approach for regularization moves us 
  from \eqref{eq:ls} to solving:
  \begin{equation}
  \label{eq:ls_pen}
  \min_\beta \, \|y - X\beta\|_2^2 + \lambda P(\beta)
  \end{equation}
  Here $P : \R^p \to \R_+$ is a penalty function, and $\lambda \geq 0$ is a
  tuning parameter (or regularization parameter), trading off the importance
  of the squared loss and penalty (first and second terms in \eqref{eq:ls_pen}) 

\item In other words, the larger the value of $\lambda$, the more weight we put
  on penalizing large values of $P(\beta)$, which results in estimates that we
  call more ``regularized''   

\item Arguably the three canonical choices for penalties are based on the
  $\ell_0$, $\ell_1$, and $\ell_2$ norms:   
  \begin{align*}
  P(\beta) &= \|\beta\|_0 = \sum_{j=1}^p 1\{\beta_j \not= 0\}, \\
  P(\beta) &= \|\beta\|_1 = \sum_{j=1}^p |\beta_j|, \\
  P(\beta) &= \|\beta\|_2^2 = \sum_{j=1}^p \beta_j^2.
  \end{align*}

\item These give rise to what we call \emph{best subset selection}, the
  \emph{lasso}, and \emph{ridge regression}, respectively  

\item (Note that calling $\|\cdot\|_0$ the ``$\ell_0$ norm'' is a misnomer, as
  it is not actually a norm: it does not satisfy positive homogeneity, i.e., 
  $\|a\beta\|_0 = a\|\beta\|_0$ for all $a>0$. It would be more accurate to
  call it the ``$\ell_0$ pseudonorm'', but nearly everybody just calls it the
  ``$\ell_0$ norm'')

\item Critically, $\|\cdot\|_0$ is \emph{not convex}, while $\|\cdot\|_1$ and 
  $\|\cdot\|_2$ are convex (note that any norm is a convex function). This makes
  best subset selection a nonconvex problem, and one that is generally hard to
  solve in practice except for small $p$. Meanwhile, the lasso and ridge
  regression are both defined by convex optimization problems, and are generally
  much easier to compute. We won't focus on best subset selection further in
  this lecture. (Though it was the topic of a flurry of work in the operations
  research literature a few years ago ... which you can ask about in office
  hours if you are curious)    

\item Lastly, an important note: when there is an explicit intercept $\beta_0$
  in the model, we typically do not want to penalize it, \emph{and so we modify
    the penalty $P(\beta)$ so that it excludes $\beta_0$}. This will be implicit
  in everything below  

\item Ok, really lastly, penalties like $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ only make sense if
  all the features (columns of $X$) are on the same scale (why?). Thus an 
  important and standard preprocessing step is to scale each feature (column of
  $X$) so that it has unit norm
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Ridge}

\begin{itemize}
\item The \emph{ridge} estimates of the regression coefficients are given by
  solving     
  \[
  \min_{\beta \in \R^p} \, \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - x_i^\T \beta)^2 + \lambda
  \sum_{j=1}^p \beta_j^2
  \]
  or equivalently
  \begin{equation}
  \label{eq:ridge}
  \min_{\beta \in \R^p} \, \|y - X \beta\|_2^2 + \lambda \|\beta\|_2^2
  \end{equation}

\item The problem in \eqref{eq:ridge} has closed-form solution, verified by  
  differentiating the criterion and setting the result equal to zero,
  \begin{equation}
  \label{eq:coef_ridge}
  \hbeta = (X^\T X + \lambda I)^{-1} X^\T y
  \end{equation}
  where $I$ is in the $p \times p$ identity matrix. This \emph{always exists}
  (the matrix $X^\T X + \lambda I$ is always invertible), regardless of the
  relative sizes of $n,p$

\item Figure \ref{fig:cardio} gives an example of the ridge regression
  coefficient estimates as a function of $\lambda$, fit on the cardiovascular 
  mortality regression data, with many features derived from lags of particulate 
  levels 

\begin{figure}[p]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.875\textwidth]{fig/cardio-ridge-1.pdf}
\includegraphics[width=0.875\textwidth]{fig/cardio-lasso-1.pdf}
\caption{Ridge and lasso estimates on the cardiovascular mortality regression
  problem, with lags of particulate levels as features. (The intercept is
  estimated without a penalty, and omitted from the plots for visualization 
  purposes).} 
\label{fig:cardio}
\end{figure}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Lasso}

\begin{itemize}
\item The \emph{lasso} estimates of the regression coefficients are given by
  solving     
  \[
  \min_{\beta \in \R^p} \, \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - x_i^\T \beta)^2 + \lambda
  \sum_{j=1}^p |\beta_j|
  \]
  or equivalently
  \begin{equation}
  \label{eq:lasso}
  \min_{\beta \in \R^p} \, \|y - X \beta\|_2^2 + \lambda \|\beta\|_1
  \end{equation}

\item There are a number of key differences between the ridge \eqref{eq:ridge}
  and \eqref{eq:lasso} problems (and estimator). First, the lasso problem does
  not have a closed-form solution (it does not even necessarily have a unique
  solution; but it is essentially always unique if we have random features from
  a continuous distribution)  

\item A second key difference is that the lasso estimates of the regression
  coefficients are \emph{sparse}. In other words, solving the lasso problem
  results in a vector \smash{$\hbeta$} with many components exactly equal to
  zero, and a larger choice of $\lambda$ will result in more zeros

\item This doesn't happen with ridge regression, whose coefficient estimates are
  generically \emph{dense}. Figure \ref{fig:lasso_ridge} is the ``classic''
  picture used to explain this, and we will talk through its interpretation in lecture 

\begin{figure}[htb]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{lasso_ridge.pdf}
\caption{The ``classic'' illustration comparing lasso and ridge, each in
  constrained form (from ``Elements of Statistical Learning'' by Hastie,
  Tibshirani, and Friedman).} 
\label{fig:lasso_ridge}
\end{figure}

\item See Figure \ref{fig:cardio} again for an example of the lasso coefficients
  on the cardiovascular mortality data. We can see that as $\lambda$ grows, it
  sets many of the coefficients of lagged features to zero

\item In general, this sparsity-inducing behavior of the $\ell_1$ penalty allows
  the lasso to perform \emph{variable selection} in the working linear model. By
  zero-ing out some coefficients exactly, it discards some features from having
  any predictive influence in the fitted model. Which precise features it
  discards is chosen based on the data. Many people like sparsity because it
  leads to better interpretability  
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Discussion: which one?}

\begin{itemize}
\item We should be clear that the lasso is not ``better'' than ridge in any
  general sense, and neither is ridge ``better'' than the lasso. They each can
  help tremendously with stabilizing coefficient estimates so as to lead to
  improved predictive accuracy. They each do so by regularizing in different
  ways 

\item The most basic question to ask: is a sparse linear model likely
  to be a good (or desirable) approximation to the true regression function? If
  so, then the lasso can outperform (or be preferable) to ridge. On the other 
  hand, in problems where there are many underlying features that are relevant
  for prediction, ridge can outperform the lasso 

\item (And often times people combine the two penalties which gives rise to the
  \emph{elastic net}) 

\item There is a lot more to say---in terms of connections to other ideas in
  statistics, extensions, and so on---but we won't be able to cover it in this
  class. We'll simply view ridge and lasso as tools that allow us to consider 
  many more features than we would otherwise feel comfortable including in
  traditional regression models, and then regularize in order to control
  variance (stabilize estimates)   

\item In time series regression, in the vein of examples we studied in the last 
  lecture, this would allow us to include \emph{many lags} of a feature of
  interest, or a few lags of \emph{many external covariates}, and so on, and
  then apply a ridge or lasso penalty

\item Then, you might wonder: how would we select $\lambda$? In fact, you
  already know the answer (for problems with a predictive focus): use time
  series cross-validation! 

\item That is, define a grid of $\lambda$ values, fit ridge or lasso estimates
  for each $\lambda$, let each one make predictions, and select the value that 
  yields the best CV error. You will practice this on the homework, where you'll
  also use the \verb|glmnet| package to solve the ridge and lasso problems 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Interlude: coordinate descent for the lasso}

\begin{itemize}
\item As a very quick interlude, here is an algorithm used to compute lasso
  estimates in practice, called \emph{coordinate descent}. In fact, this is what
  is used by the \verb|glmnet| package internally. We repeat, cycling over 
  $j=1,2,\dots,p$ until convergence (until the coefficient estimates do not
  really change anymore), the following steps (with $x_j$ denoting the $j\th$
  column of $X$): 

\begin{itemize}
\item Compute the $j\th$ partial residual: $r_j = y - \sum_{\ell \not= j} x_\ell 
  \hbeta_\ell$  

\item Compute the univariate least squares coefficient of $r_j$ on $x_j$: 
  \[
  \check\beta_j = \frac{x_j^\T r_j}{x_j^\T x_j}
  \]

\item Update the $j\th$ lasso coefficient by ``soft-thresholding'' the above: 
  \[
  \hbeta_j = \begin{cases}
  \check\beta_j+2\lambda & \text{if $\check\beta_j < -2\lambda \|x_j\|_2^2$} \\   
  \check\beta_j-2\lambda & \text{if $\check\beta_j > +2\lambda \|x_j\|_2^2$} \\  
  0 & \text{otherwise}
  \end{cases}
  \]
  where recall $\lambda$ is the lasso regularization parameter 
\end{itemize}

\item (Note that similarity here between this algorithm and the connection
  between marginal and multiple regression that we covered previously. In fact,
  this algorithm is still valid when $\lambda = 0$, and it can be used to
  compute least squares coefficients!)  
\end{itemize}

\section{Smoothing}

\begin{itemize}
\item Shifting gears, we will now talk about \emph{smoothing}, which for us will
  be a tool that is mainly used for retrospective rather than prospective
  estimation (as in forecasting)   

\item As with regression, most smoothing techniques are not actually specific to
  time series data, so our notation will be generic to reflect this. There are
  so many smoothers out there, and we will choose three ones to discuss that are
  generic in principle, but are quite popular (and in part, have roots in) the
  time series context  

\item Recall the signal plus noise model from our earlier lectures, 
  \[
  y_i = \theta_i + \epsilon_i, \quad i = 1,\dots,n
  \]
  where $\epsilon_i$, $i=1,\dots,n$ are white noise errors, and $\theta_i$, $i =
  1,\dots,n$ denote the unknown means that we want to estimate, assumed to be
  smoothly varying across the index $i$

\item Two broad classes of smoothers of interest are as follow. The first are
  \emph{linear filters}, which are (weighted) local averages, of the form  
  \begin{equation}
  \label{eq:smooth_lin}
  \htheta_i = \sum_{j=-k}^k a_j y_{i-j},\quad i = 1,\dots,n
  \end{equation}
  for some weights $a_j$, $j = -k,\dots,k$

\item The second are \emph{penalized least squares} smoothers, which are given
  by solving    
  \begin{equation}
  \label{eq:smooth_pen}
  \min_{\theta \in \R^n} \, \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \theta_i)^2 + \lambda P(\theta) 
  \end{equation}
  for some penalty function $P : \R^n \to \R_+$ and tuning parameter $\lambda 
  \geq 0$   

\item You should be able to clearly see the connection between smoothing and
  regularization, with \eqref{eq:smooth_pen} being a special case of
  \eqref{eq:ls_pen} (when $X = I$, the identity matrix). Note, the choice of
  penalties that are common and useful in smoothing, as we'll see below, are
  more complex than simple $\ell_1$ or $\ell_2$ penalties  

\item There is a broader connection between smoothing and regression, embodied
  by what is called an \emph{additive model}. In one sentence: this is a
  regression, but with individual features replaced by nonlinear transforms of
  features, where the nonlinearities are fit by smoothers. We'll very briefly
  return to this at the end
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Linear filters}

\begin{itemize}
\item A \emph{moving average} (MA), either of centered or trailing type, is one
  of the basic and widely-used examples of a linear filter, of the form 
  \eqref{eq:smooth_lin}. For a window of (odd) length $m = 2k+1$, a centered MA
  smoother uses weights 
  \[
  a_{-k} = \cdots a_0 = \cdots = a_k = \frac{1}{m}
  \]
  For a window of (odd or even) length $m = k+1$, a trailing MA smoother uses
  weights 
  \[
  a_{-k} = \cdots = a_{-1} = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad 
  a_0 = \cdots = a_k = \frac{1}{m} 
  \]

\item (For either, centered or trailing MA smoothers, or really linear filters
  in general, there will be annoying boundary issues to pay attention to
  ... some software packages may just pad the response vector with 0s in order
  to deal with them; but a more principled approach is probably to renormalize
  the weights at the boundaries so that the filter is averaging over the
  ``right'' number of observations; and the safest approach is to just omit 
  estimates at the boundaries, i.e., report NAs)

\item Figure \ref{fig:soi} displays an example of centered MA smoothing on the 
  Southern Oscillation Index (SOI), which measures air pressure in the Central 
  Pacific Ocean. We can see that the results look fairly accurate (they track
  the known cycles which occur every 3-7 years, due to the El Nino effect), but
  the estimates look a bit ``choppy''    

\begin{figure}[p]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.875\textwidth]{fig/soi-ma-1.pdf}
\includegraphics[width=0.875\textwidth]{fig/soi-ks-1.pdf}
\caption{Moving average and Gaussian kernel smoothing estimates fit to the
  Southern Oscillation Index (from SS).}  
\label{fig:soi}
\end{figure}

\item We can get smoother-looking estimates by using a smoother weight sequence
  (with larger $k$). This is precisely what \emph{kernel smoothing} does: it
  uses $k = n$ and 
  \[
  a_j = \frac{K(j/b)}{\sum_{i=-n}^n K(i/b)}, \quad j = 1,\dots,n 
  \]
  for a particular \emph{kernel function} $K : \R \to \R$ and \emph{bandwidth}
  $b$. Think of the bandwidth as a tuning parameter, just like the
  regularization level $\lambda$ in ridge or lasso 

\item A common choice of kernel is the Gaussian kernel, $K(u) =
  e^{-u^2/2}$. Figure \ref{fig:soi} gives an example of Gaussian kernel
  smoothing on the SOI data again. We can see that the estimates look more
  smooth  

\item (Note that a centered MA is actually kernel smoothing with a ``boxcar''
  kernel: $K(u) = 1\{|u| \leq b\}$)     
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Hodrick-Prescott filter}

\begin{itemize}
\item The \emph{Hodrick-Prescott filter}, or simply HP filter, is a penalized 
  estimator of the form \eqref{eq:smooth_pen}, defined by 
  \begin{equation}
  \label{eq:hp_filter}
  \min_{\theta \in \R^n} \, \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \theta_i)^2 + \lambda
  \sum_{i=1}^{n-2} (\theta_i - 2\theta_{i+1} + \theta_{i+2})^2
  \end{equation}

\item We can see that the penalty is squared $\ell_2$ norm of the terms
  $\theta_i -  2\theta_{i+1} + \theta_{i+2}$, $i = 1,\dots,n-2$. Each of these
  are a \emph{second difference} of $\theta$, centered at a particular index 

\item The HP filter is named after two econometricians who proposed the idea in
  the early 1980s. But it is worth noting that very similar ideas were around
  much, much early (the idea of penalizing according to squared first
  differences dates back to the 1899, and according to squared third differences
  dates back to 1923)    

\item Like the ridge problem, which is similar in spirit (but aimed at solving a 
  different problem), the HP filter problem \eqref{eq:hp_filter} has an exact 
  solution. First define the second difference matrix $D \in \R^{(n-2) \times
    n}$ by 
  \begin{equation}
  \label{eq:d_mat}
  D = \begin{bmatrix}
  1 & -2 & 1 & 0 & 0 & \cdots & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
  0 & 1 & -2 & 1 & 0 & \cdots & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
  0 & 0 & 1 & -2 & 1 & \cdots & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
  \vdots & & & \cdot & & & \\
  0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \cdots & 1 & -2 & 1 \\
  \end{bmatrix}
  \end{equation}
  and then rewrite the HP filter optimization problem \eqref{eq:hp_filter} as 
  \begin{equation}
  \label{eq:hp_filter2}
  \min_{\theta \in \R^n} \, \|y - \theta\|_2^2 + \lambda \|D \theta\|_2^2 
  \end{equation}

\item The HP filter solution can be derived by differentiating the criterion in
  \eqref{eq:hp_filter2}, setting it equal to zero, and solving, which yields 
  \begin{equation}
  \label{eq:theta_hp}
  \htheta = (I + \lambda D^\T D)^{-1} y
  \end{equation}

\item Figure \ref{fig:boston} shows an example of the HP filter fit to the
  winning men's times from the Boston marathon, at a few different values of the 
  regularization level $\lambda$. (What happens to the HP filter as $\lambda \to
  \infty$?)     

\item The HP filter has a computational advantage a linear filter with smooth
  weights, such as the Gaussian kernel smoother (the HP filter can be computed
  in linear-time because $D$ is banded). In terms of their qualitative behavior, 
  the HP filter and a Gaussian kernel smoother are pretty similar     

\item In fact, though it not obvious at all, the HP filter admits an
  \emph{equivalent} form as a kernel smoother, for a special implicit kernel 
  (you will study this as a bonus problem on the homework) 

\item The HP filter is worth knowing about because it is quite a popular tool in
  macroeconomics, where it is primarily used for time series decomposition: it
  is used to estimate a trend component in a time series, and then the residuals
  from this are used to estimate a cyclic component. However, recently, some 
  econometricians have criticized this practice, on the basis that it can induce
  spurious correlations in the residuals, along with other
  concerns.\footnote{See Hamilton ``Why you should never use the  
    Hodrick-Prescott filter'' (2017), but also Hodrick ``An exploration of
    trend-cycle decomposition methodologies in simulated data'' (2020), for a
    rebuttal which challenges some of the ideas proposed by Hamilton. Hodrick  
    finds empirically that the HP filter does a better job of isolating the
    cyclic component (in simulation) than the regression method proposed by   
    Hamilton.}  

\item Another reason worth learning about the HP filter is that it provides us a
  natural bridge to another method that we'll cover next, which acts completely 
  differently from any linear filter
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Trend filter}

\begin{itemize}
\item The \emph{$\ell_1$ trend filter}, or simply trend filter, is another
  penalized estimator of the form \eqref{eq:smooth_pen}, defined by     
  \begin{equation}
  \label{eq:trend_filter} 
  \min_{\theta \in \R^n} \, \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \theta_i)^2 + \lambda
  \sum_{i=1}^{n-2} |\theta_i - 2\theta_{i+1} + \theta_{i+2}|
  \end{equation}

\item We can see that the penalty is the $\ell_1$ norm of second differences of
  $\theta$. Thus, compared do the HP filter, the only difference is in the use
  of an $\ell_1$ norm penalty, and not squared $\ell_2$ norm penalty

\item Just as in \eqref{eq:hp_filter2}, we can rewrite the trend filter
  \eqref{eq:trend_filter} more compactly as
  \begin{equation}
  \label{eq:trend_filter2}
  \min_{\theta \in \R^n} \, \|y - \theta\|_2^2 + \lambda \|D \theta\|_1 
  \end{equation}
  where $D \in \R^{(n-2) \times n}$ is the second difference matrix in
  \eqref{eq:d_mat} 

\item Swapping the squared $\ell_2$ penalty with an $\ell_1$ penalty on second
  differences results in a \emph{very} different behavior in the estimator. 
  Think of the analogy of ridge versus the lasso. Trend filtering yields
  estimates that are \emph{sparse} in second differences: if we denote by
  \smash{$\htheta$} the solution vector in \eqref{eq:trend_filter2}, then many
  components of \smash{$D \htheta$} will be exactly equal to zero, and a larger
  choice of $\lambda$ will generally result in more zeros 

\item Since 
  \[
  \htheta_i - 2\htheta_{i+1} + \htheta_{i+2} = 0 \iff  
  \htheta_{i+1} = \frac{\htheta_i + \htheta_{i+2}}{2} 
  \]
  this means that many components \smash{$\htheta_i$} will lie on the line
  defined by their neighbors

\item Or in other words, the trend filter solution \smash{$\htheta$} will have a
  \emph{piecewise linear} structure, with a kink at each point $i$ such that
  \smash{$\htheta_{i+1} \not= (\htheta_i + \htheta_{i+2})/2$}. These kink points
  (also called knot points) are chosen adaptively, based on the data

  marathon times (from HA), each at a few different values of $\lambda$.}    
\label{fig:boston}
\end{figure}

\item Figure \ref{fig:boston} shows an example of the trend filter on Boston
  marathon data again. The piecewise linear structure, and qualitative
  difference to the HP filter, is very clear. (What is the behavior of trend
  filtering as $\lambda \to \infty$?) 

\item So, how do you choose the regularization level $\lambda$ in the trend 
  filter or HP filter, or bandwidth $b$ in a kernel smoother? Cross-validation!
  (Are you tired of that answer by now?) This is actually closer to traditional
  CV, rather than time series CV (since we are not in a forecasting setting,
  where we are predicting the future), but just more structured in how we form
  the folds

\item To tune any one of the smoothers described above, we can define (say) 5
  folds using every $5\th$ point in the sequence. That is, we leave out every
  $5\th$ point, fit the smoother on the remaining points, over a grid of tuning 
  parameter values, and calculate the squared error on the held-out
  points.\footnote{To form an estimate at each held-out point, we can use
    linear interpolation of the estimates at its neighbors.} 
  Doing this 4 more times, where each time we shift the indices of the held-out
  points forward by one, we will be able to compute the average error over all
  points, and use this to select the tuning parameter value. You'll get to see
  this on the homework

\item (An important side note: trend filtering can be extended to model a
  piecewise polynomial of an arbitrary degree, not just linear; as in the above, 
  the knots in this piecewise polynomial will be chosen adaptively based on the 
  data. So it can generate smoother-looking fits, like the HP filter or kernel 
  smoothing, but the key difference is that it has a property called \emph{local
    adaptivity}, which comes from its ability to select knots based on the
  data. Ask about this in office hours if you are curious to hear more!) 
\end{itemize}

\section{Additive models}

\begin{itemize}
\item To gear up to very briefly discuss additive models, we have to first
  make clear the following point: \emph{each one of the smoothers described in
    the last section can be extended to a problem where the input points in the
    underlying smoothing problem are arbitrary: $x_i$, $i = 1,\dots,n$ (rather
    than simply $x_i = i$, as would be the case in standard time series)}

\item Now let's introduce the \emph{additive model}. This extends the basic
  multivariate linear regression model:
  \[
  y_i \approx \beta_0 + \sum_{j=1}^p \beta_j x_{ij}, \quad i = 1,\dots,n
  \]
  to 
  \[
  y_i \approx \beta_0 + \sum_{j=1}^p f_j(x_{ij}), \quad i = 1,\dots,n
  \]
  where each $f_j$ is a smooth transformation to be estimated

\item In other words, we have moved from estimating linear transformations of
  the features to \emph{nonlinear} ones, which we fit using a smoother
  (traditional packages use kernel smoothing, or spline smoothing, which is
  similar to using the HP filter) 

\item This can be super useful, and hopefully you'll learn about this in more
  detail in your regression class (or some advanced modeling class). For us, it
  is mostly just an idea mentioned in passing. But towards the end of the
  course, when we cover the Prophet forecasting model, you will see it in action
